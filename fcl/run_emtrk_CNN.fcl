# Example minimal configuration to run EM/track separation in front of 3D track reconstruction
# The module produces tracks where seed (cluster from which track is initiated) has to be
# track-like. Since it is still possible that electron track was reconstructed, the resulting
# 3D track is checked in its best projection and if CNN output there, using all hits, is below
# track-like threshold, the corresponding PFParticle is tagged with PDG code 11 (electron).
