# ndksens: nucleon decay sensitivity

ndksens is a set of python scripts to compute partial lifetime sensitivities as a function of exposure for nucleon decay experimental searches. Pre-defined efficiency/background rate assumptions for several decay modes are defined for an argon-based DUNE-like setup. The scripts can also be easily customized for any other source/efficiency/background conditions.   

### Authors and credits

ndksens is written and maintained by Michel Sorel (sorel@fnal.gov). 

ndksens originates from pybbsens, a similar set of scripts for neutrinoless double beta decay searches, written and maintained by Justo Martin-Albo and Juan Jose Gomez-Cadenas. For more details about pybbsens, see: https://github.com/jmalbos/pybbsens

The decay mode numbering scheme adopted matches the one of the Particle Data Group, see: http://pdg.lbl.gov/2015/listings/rpp2015-list-p.pdf

The pre-defined efficiency/background assumptions for an argon-based detector are taken from:
